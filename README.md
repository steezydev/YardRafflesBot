> YardBot is a telegram bot and part of **YardRaffles** project. It was created to give users easy and native experience using YardRaffles system.

# About
Often rare items of clothing (most often sneakers) are sold in a limited number and it can be quite difficult to buy them.  Therefore, big brands and their retailers organize raffles for the "right to buy" a rare item of fashion in order to gain an audience for their social media accounts.

This project is aimed at raffles. The main goal is to enable people who don't resell things to make profit with their luck.

## Structure
Our project consists of 3 parts:
 - **API** - the heart of the system (working with the database, data processing)
 - **Dashboard** - for content management and statistics monitoring
 - **<ins>Telegram bot</ins>** - set of tools and announcements for users

**Telegram bot** is basically a mini-application for the user. The main function of the bot is to notify the user about the raffles (beginning, end, results) and receive a response from him in the *"I participate"* style, which is recorded in the database.  This allows to keep statistics of participation and winnings in the raffles.  And moreâ€¦
